# Introduction
There are total 8 issues, each student is required to finish one. We have *create an issue* and *project board*. After creating the readme.md, we will _show our team B to the internet_ to let more people know us. Then, we will _keep checking_ and _write C code_. After that, we will _get a status badge_. And finally, _promoting our repo_.
